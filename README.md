# GameAdmin
## What is GameAdmin?
GameAdmin is an elegant and easy to use application to keep track of a sports game. It is currently aimed to be used in canoe polo tournaments.

## What does GameAdmin do?
GameAdmin is still being worked on at this moment, but these are the plans:

### Standalone timer, shotclock and scores [WIP]
This mode is made to work without any external systems. It just keeps track of the basics for a canoe polo match: the timer, shotclocks and scores. 

TODO:
- [X] UI
- [X] Game flow (break, switching sides, ...)
- [ ] Settings (Period length, number of periods, break length, ...)
- [ ] Popups (When the break starts/ends, shotclocks run out, ...)

### Integration with a bluetooth scoreboard [Planned]
This mode wil look exactly like the standalone mode, with the only difference that it is connected to a fysical scoreboard via bluetooth.

### Integration with Tournament Organiser [Planned]
This mode wil be based off the standalone mode (with the option to enable a bluetooth connection). It adds extra features like the ability to load in actual team names and colours. It will also be able to keep track of goal and card counts for every individual player. After the match has finished, it will send all data back to the server and load the next game to be played. 

As the title suggests, this mode is made to work with [Tournament Organiser](http://www.rectusoft.com/tournament_organizer.html).
